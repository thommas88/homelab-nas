# Project Timeline – Homelab NAS

## 13.08.25 – First Installation of Proxmox
- Installed Proxmox for the first time. No prior experience with Proxmox or Linux.  
- **Goal:** Run a Satisfactory server on a Windows VM and share a few HDDs on the network.  
**Result:** Proxmox up and running on a machine with a 230 GB SSD as the OS disk.  
**Learning:** First exposure to hypervisor and VM management. Gained an overview of the GUI and basic concepts.

## 23.08.25 – Planning the VM Structure
- Explored Proxmox further and gained insight into possibilities.  
- Planned VM setup:  
  - TrueNAS VM for storage and backup  
  - Immich VM to replace Google Photos  
  - Windows VM with SteamCMD (host game servers) and other use cases  
- After evaluating hardware, ordered 2 additional HDDs and a new case.  
**Result:** Clear plan for how to separate roles into dedicated VMs.  
**Learning:** Important to separate functions into their own VMs for flexibility and maintainability.

## 29.08.25 – Hardware Upgrade
- Upgraded case and storage capacity.  
- Replaced old case (Corsair 4000D Airflow) with Fractal Define 7 due to limited HDD space.  
- Added **2×8 TB Seagate IronWolf NAS HDDs** intended for TrueNAS.
- Added ram, Went from 32gb -> 64gb.  
- Assigned the **2×2 TB drives** to Immich (photo backups).  
**Result:** The machine now had space for more drives and improved cooling, ready for the NAS project.  
**Learning:** Physical space and cooling are critical in projects with many disks. Hardware planning is just as important as software setup.

## 31.08.25 – TrueNAS and Windows VM
- Created a TrueNAS VM in Proxmox (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 64 GB system disk).  
- Passed through the two new 8 TB drives → created a **ZFS Mirror pool** (~7.14 TiB usable).  
- Created datasets: `Files`, `Photos`, `Videos`.  
- Set up SMB shares and tested access from Windows with a new user.  
- Created a **“daily” user with read-only rights** to avoid always using the admin account. This improves security by limiting potential damage if credentials are compromised.  
- Changed from DHCP to **static IP (192.168.xx.xx)** and set a DHCP reservation in the router.  
- Also created a Windows VM (no active use case yet).  
**Result:** NAS setup functional, shares accessible across devices on the network.  
**Learning:** Important to use datasets instead of sharing the pool root. Gained experience with ACL and permissions management in TrueNAS.

## 05.09.25 – Testing Reboot and Automation
- Stopped all VMs and restarted the server to test automation.  
- Found that Immich was not connected to the 2×2 TB ZFS pool, but instead used the default 70 GB system disk.  
- Fixed the issue → ensured Immich now uses the correct ZFS mount.  
**Result:** immich fix had to wait for another day
**Learning:** Testing reboots is essential to confirm mounts persist. Learned that Docker/VMs can fall back to the system disk if mounts are not ready—must standardize mounts to avoid this.

## 08.10.25 - Dropped windows, installed linux
- Linux installation
- Installed valheim
- Installed Minecraft
- Added a 3TB disk to TrueNas as network workdrive.
**Problem:** University network and friends connecting.

---

## 20.10.25 - Fixing issues with connectivity
-Had problems with other players connecting to my servers.
  - Tried tailscale at first to bypass the university strick ports and network.
  - Got told about Playit.gg and how i can use that as a fix to my problem(worked great)
- I set up a Rclone with backup to google drive of minecraft world incase server goes down.
  - With more players connecting and inviesting time i wanted to offer a backup solution incase i tinker too much and break server.

## 01.11.25 – Immich and the 2x2 TB Disks
- Set up an **Immich server** in a dedicated Ubuntu VM (Docker + Compose).  
- Tested mobile photo uploads: worked successfully on local Wi-Fi (home router).  
**Result:** Immich online and syncing photos automatically from mobile.

## 26.10.25 – HP EliteDesk g5
- 
**Result:** 
**Learning:**
