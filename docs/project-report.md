# Homelab NAS Project with Proxmox and TrueNAS SCALE

## System Specifications

**Host Server (Proxmox VE)**
- CPU: Intel i9-9900K
- RAM: 32 GB DDR4
- Boot Drive: 1 Ã— 500 GB SSD (Proxmox OS)
- Storage Drives:
  - 2 Ã— 8 TB HDD (ZFS mirror for NAS storage)
  - 2 Ã— 2 TB HDD (planned for additional use, e.g. testing or secondary pool)
- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti (not used for this project, possible for Jellyfin hardware transcoding later)
- Network: 1 Gbit/s LAN

**Virtual Machines**
- **TrueNAS SCALE VM**
  - CPU: 4 vCPUs (host-passthrough)
  - RAM: 8â€“12 GB
  - Storage: 2 Ã— 8 TB raw disk passthrough (ZFS mirror pool `tank`)
- **Windows 11 VM (test client)**
  - CPU: 2 vCPUs
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - Purpose: verify SMB/NFS connectivity and NAS functionality

**Operating System Versions**
  - Proxmox VE 8.x
  - TrueNAS SCALE 24.x
  - Windows 11 Pro (for test-VM)




>The two 2 TB HDDs are currently reserved for additional testing (e.g., creating a secondary pool or acting as a backup target). They are not part of the main ZFS mirror pool.

>Power/UPS has been considered, and might be added later.

## Planning Phase

### Requirements
- Storage of data and photos in a safe and robust way.  
- Redundancy (able to survive a single disk failure without data loss).  
- Automatic photo backup from Android phone.  
- Media server (Jellyfin) for movies and TV shows on the living room TV.  
- Access to data from both physical PCs and VMs.
- **Security/Backup requirement:** Data integrity checks (bitrot protection) and offsite backup considered essential for photos.  

### Alternatives Considered
- **ZFS directly in Proxmox** with a lightweight Linux container sharing via Samba/NFS.  
- **TrueNAS SCALE as a VM** on Proxmox, with raw disk passthrough.  
- **UnRAID** for flexibility with adding single disks, but without true bitrot protection.  

### Chosen Solution
I decided to run **TrueNAS SCALE as a VM in Proxmox** with raw-disk passthrough.  
Reasons:  
- TrueNAS provides a robust GUI and many built-in services (SMB, NFS, iSCSI, app catalog).  
- ZFS is managed in one place (within TrueNAS), making the system simpler to operate.  
- Strong for portfolio purposes â†’ combination of hypervisor (Proxmox) and enterprise storage solution (ZFS).

## Setup Phase

### Proxmox Installation
- Installed Proxmox on a dedicated system disk (SSD).  
- Left the two 8 TB HDDs untouched so they could be passed raw into TrueNAS.

### TrueNAS VM
- Created VM with 8 GB RAM, CPU type `host`, VirtIO NIC.  
- Disks added via passthrough using `/dev/disk/by-id/...`.  

*(Screenshot: VM settings in Proxmox)*  

### ZFS Pool
- Created ZFS pool `tank` in TrueNAS as a mirror (RAID1) of the two 8 TB disks.  
- Result: 8 TB usable capacity with redundancy.

### Network Sharing
- Configured SMB shares for access from Windows.  
- Tested connection from a Windows VM and a physical PC.  

*(Screenshot: Windows connecting to `\\truenas\share`)*  

### Apps
- **Immich** for automatic Android photo backup â†’ pointing to `tank/photos`.  
- **Jellyfin** as a media server â†’ pointing to `tank/media/movies` and `tank/media/tv`.

## Testing and Operation

### Failover Test
- Physically disconnected one disk during operation.  
- ZFS marked the pool as `DEGRADED`, but all data remained available.  
- When the disk was reinserted, the rebuild started automatically.  

### Snapshots
- Configured snapshots on `tank/photos`.  
- **Snapshot schedule:**  
  - Daily snapshots, kept for 30 days.  
  - Weekly snapshots, kept for 12 weeks.  
  - Monthly snapshots, kept for 12 months.  
- Test: deleted a file and rolled back snapshot â†’ file successfully restored.

### Scrubs
- **Scrub schedule:** Monthly scrubs scheduled on the `tank` pool to ensure data integrity and detect latent errors.  

### Performance
- Ran `iperf3` between Windows PC and NAS â†’ ~1 Gbit/s, as expected.  
- File copy test (large file) â†’ ~110 MB/s over SMB.

## Reflection
- The project provided hands-on experience with both a hypervisor (Proxmox) and a storage platform (TrueNAS + ZFS).  
- I learned about design trade-offs between flexibility (UnRAID) and robustness (ZFS).  
- The setup can be scaled by adding new mirror pairs for increased capacity.
