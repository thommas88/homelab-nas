## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines current and planned improvements to the homelab environment, focusing on stability, automation, and service expansion.

###  Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (Completed)
- [x] Deploy Proxmox VE 8.x as hypervisor (`proxmox01`)
- [x] Set up TrueNAS SCALE VM with ZFS mirrors (2×8 TB + 2×2 TB)
- [x] Configure SMB/NFS shares for NAS access
- [x] Create Linux VM for Docker containers (`docker01`)
- [x] Deploy Pi-hole container for DNS filtering (`pihole01`)
- [x] Deploy Immich container for automated photo backup (`immich01`)
- [x] Implement offsite Rclone backup for Minecraft server

###  Phase 2 - Monitoring, Security, and Optimization (In Progress)
- [ ] Install and configure **Netdata** for live system monitoring  
- [ ] Deploy **Bitwarden** for secure credential management  
- [ ] Test **Syncthing** for cross-device file synchronization  
- [ ] Enable **Portainer** for easier Docker management  
- [ ] Evaluate **Tailscale** or **WireGuard** for secure remote access  
- [ ] Set up **Grafana + Prometheus** dashboard for host metrics  
- [ ] Automate snapshots and vzdump VM backups to TrueNAS  

###  Phase 3 - Service Expansion (Planned)
- [ ] Deploy **Nextcloud** for document storage and collaboration  
- [ ] Deploy **Jellyfin** for media streaming  
- [ ] Integrate **Bitwarden**, **Nextcloud**, and **Immich** with single sign-on (SSO)  
- [ ] Add **UPS integration** for power monitoring and automatic shutdown  
- [ ] Set up **offsite backup node** (HP EliteDesk G5) with rclone sync  
- [ ] Configure alerting via Discord or Telegram webhooks  

###  Long-Term Improvements (Future Goals)
- [ ] Move select containers to LXC for resource efficiency  
- [ ] Implement redundant storage replication between TrueNAS pools  
- [ ] Test SSD caching for NAS performance optimization  
- [ ] Explore Kubernetes or Docker Swarm orchestration  
- [ ] Create unified dashboard for all homelab metrics
